      "solve": "Water animals, like dolphins and sharks, live in aquatic environments where they are adapted to swim, dive, and thrive in the water. Dolphins, for example, are known for their playful nature and live in oceans and seas, while sharks are predatory creatures that also call the waters of the oceans home. On the other hand, land animals like elephants and lions are adapted to life on land, with features such as strong limbs and specialized behaviors for surviving in terrestrial environments. Elephants, massive creatures with their large ears and trunks, roam across savannahs and forests, whereas lions, known for their strength and hunting prowess, live in grassy plains and are often referred to as the kings of the jungle."

Touch sensory details are those that describe physical sensations, like the 'rough sandpaper' that feels abrasive or the 'smooth silk' that feels soft and cool. Smell sensory details involve describing aromas, like the 'fresh coffee' scent in the morning or the 'salty ocean breeze' felt by a beachgoer. Taste sensory details are those that involve flavor, such as the sweetness of 'honey' or the sharpness of 'spicy pepper' that can be felt on the tongue."
